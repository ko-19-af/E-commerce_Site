# E-commerce_Site
A showcase on the development of my front/back-end programming abilities.

Each Folder contains a version of an E-commerce site I develpoed over the course of COSC 2P89 (Internet Technologies).
Each Folder builds on the last as new components are added to increase the websites functionality.

Including: Wishlists, Administrative login functionality, customer login, server-side storage of customer wishlists, etc.
